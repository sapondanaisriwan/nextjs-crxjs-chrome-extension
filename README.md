# NextJS & CRXJS chrome extension boilerplate

A chrome extension boilerplate using Next.js for building products and CRXJS for development.

## Why need to combine NextJS with CRXJS?

- I'm experiencing content script injected gets delayed a lot when build the products.
- I'm experiencing when clicking the extension icon, the popup displays too slow.

so I decided to choose NextJS for building the product instead of CRXJS.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the project**:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sapondanaisriwan/nextjs-crxjs-chrome-extension.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Development

To start development, run:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Alternatively, you can click the "Run" button at the bottom left corner of your VS Code.

## Building

To build the project, use:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Alternatively, you can click the "Run" button at the bottom left corner of your VS Code.
